📅 Day 1 – Databricks & Lakehouse Fundamentals

🚀 Databricks 14-Day Challenge – Day 1

Day 1 focuses on building a strong conceptual foundation for Databricks and modern data engineering. The objective was not to rush into coding, but to clearly understand why Databricks exists, what problems it solves, and how the Lakehouse architecture fits into real-world data systems.

This day sets the base for everything that follows in the challenge.

🧠 Topics Covered
1️⃣ What is Databricks?

Unified analytics platform built on Apache Spark

Designed for data engineering, data science, and machine learning

Eliminates fragmentation between data lakes and data warehouses

2️⃣ Problems with Traditional Architectures

Data Lakes → Cheap storage but poor performance & governance

Data Warehouses → Fast analytics but expensive & rigid

Complex pipelines to move data between systems

3️⃣ Lakehouse Architecture (Core Concept)

Databricks introduced the Lakehouse to combine the best of both worlds:

Feature	Benefit
Data Lake storage	Low cost & scalability
Warehouse performance	Fast SQL & BI queries
Open formats	No vendor lock-in
Unified platform	One system for ETL, BI, ML
4️⃣ Key Components Introduced

Apache Spark – Distributed processing engine

Delta Lake – Reliable storage layer on top of data lakes

ACID transactions

Schema enforcement

Time travel

Databricks Workspace – Collaborative environment for notebooks & jobs

5️⃣ Why Databricks for Data Engineers?

Handles large-scale data efficiently

Supports batch + streaming

Simplifies pipeline development

Industry-standard for modern data platforms

🎯 Outcome of Day 1

By the end of Day 1, I clearly understood:

Why Databricks was created

How Lakehouse architecture solves real problems

The role of Spark & Delta Lake

How this knowledge connects to real production systems

This foundation prepares us for hands-on Spark & Databricks work from Day 2 onward.
